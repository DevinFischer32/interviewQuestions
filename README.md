1. All technical people have an "approach" to solving large, complex problems, and in my experience, these approaches generally fit into one of three categories:


2. In my experience, technical people tend to fit into one of two categories which I term "leapers" and "grinders". A leaper will make significant intuitive jumps forward based on incomplete information and be right perhaps 70% to 80% of the time, making it worth the risk. A grinder starts at point A and grinds through every permutation on the way to point B, leaving no direct conclusion untouched, but arriving much slower than a leaper.A good technical team requires a balance of both - leapers to push the grinders forward and work outside the box, and grinders to catch the mistakes and fill in the gaps.
